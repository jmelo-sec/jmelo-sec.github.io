I am a Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in cybersecurity, particularly in Blue Team operations, network traffic analysis, system hardening and cloud security.

My approach to learning is hands-on: understanding how systems behave, how networks communicate and how to detect anomalies through logs and traffic inspection. This portfolio serves as a place to document my technical work, labs and security-focused experiments.

My career goal is to transition into roles such as **Security Engineer** or **SOC Analyst**, ideally within international environments such as Switzerland.
