I am a Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in cybersecurity, especially in Blue Team operations, network traffic analysis, system hardening and cloud security.

My learning approach is very hands-on: I like to see what is really happening in the network and on the systems, read the logs, capture the packets and then translate that into security conclusions.

This portfolio is where I document my labs, experiments and security projects.  
My medium-term goal is to move into roles such as **Security Engineer** or **SOC Analyst**, ideally in an international environment such as Switzerland.
